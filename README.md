The HackerRank company focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers and businesses, where developers compete to program according to the specifications provided. Various programming languages (including Java, C++, PHP, Python, SQL, and JavaScript) and multiple computer science domains are supported by HackerRank. Programmers are scored based on the accuracy of their output when they submit a solution to a programming challenge. In order to drive competition among users, programmers earn badges based on their accomplishments on the HackerRank leaderboard.
